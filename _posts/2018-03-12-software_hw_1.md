1. 简单题
- 软件工程的定义
  Software engineering is “(1) the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software,” and “(2) the study of approaches as in (1).” – IEEE Standard 610.12

- 阅读经典名著“人月神话”等资料，解释 software crisis、COCOMO 模型。
  - software crisis：
  Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could not be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were insufficient.

  - COCOMO模型：
  COCOMO,英文全称为constructive cost model,中文为构造性成本模型.它是一种精确、易于使用的,基于模型的成本估算方法，最早由勃姆 (Boehm) 于 1981 年提出。从本质上说是一种参数化的项目估算方法,参数建模是把下那个目的某些特征作为参数,通过建立一个数字模型预测项目成本。
  在COCOMO模型中,工作量调整因子(Effort Adjustment Factor, EAF)代表多个参数的综合效果,这些参数使得项目可以特征化和根据COCOMO数据库中的项目规格化.每个参数可以定位很低,低,正常,高,很高.每个参数都作为乘数,其值通常在0.5到1.5之间,这些参数的乘积作为成本方程中的系数.
